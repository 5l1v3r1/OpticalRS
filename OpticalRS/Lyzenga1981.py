def attenuation_coef_ratio(band_i,band_j,transform=np.log):
    r"""
    Calculate the attenuation coefficient ratio as described in Lyzenga (1981).
    You should supply this function with arrays that are drawn from an area of
    uniform bottom type and varying depth. Sand is usually pretty easy to 
    identify and seems to be the substrate of choice for this sort of thing.
    
    Args:
        band_i (numpy.array): array of reflectance values over a uniform stubstrate
            and varying depths for band i (whatever band you choose).
            
        band_j (numpy.array): array of reflectance values over the same area as band
            i from a different band, j.
            
    Returns:
        float. The attention coeffiecient ratio.

        \frac{k_i}{k_j} = a + \sqrt{ a^2 + 1 }
        where:
        a = \frac{ \sigma_i - \sigma_j }{ 2\sigma_{ij} }
        
    :math:`\sigma_i` is the variance of :math:`band_i`, :math:`\sigma_j` is the
    variance of :math:`band_j` and :math:`\sigma_{ij}` is the covariance between
    :math:`band_i` and :math:`band_j`.

    This method implements equation 2 from Lyzenga 1981 to generate a single depth
    invariant index from a pair of bands.
    
    Args:
        imarr (numpy.array): This is the image array of shape (Rows,Cols,Bands)
        
        sandarr (numpy.array): This is an array image array that contains only
            pixels from a uniform bottom type (usually sand) and varying depth.
            Values from this array will be passed to the attenuation_coef_ratio
            method.

            in the calculation of the index.
