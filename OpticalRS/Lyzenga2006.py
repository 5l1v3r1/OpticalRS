This module is a part of the OpticalRS library. It implements methods described
in Lyzenga et al. 2006. This implementation is the work of the author of this
code (Jared Kibele), not the authors of the original paper. I tried to get it 
right but I'm not making any promises. Please check your results and let me 
know if you find any problems.

    """
    Return a single band boolean array with all pixels <= the `p` percentile of
    brightness (across all bands) marked as `True`. All other pixels marked as
    `False`. This method was developed to carry out the following step from
    section V of Lyzenga et al. 2006:
    
    "A first estimate of the mean deep-water radiance is calculated by first 
    identifying the tenth-percentile brightness magnitude (using all four 
    bands) within the water area of interest."

    Parameters
    ----------
    imarr : numpy array (RxCxBands shape)
        The multispectral image array. See `OpticalRS.RasterDS` for more info.
        
    p : int or float (Default value = 10)
        The percentile of brightness to use as the threshold for declaring a
        pixel 'dark'. Lyzenga et al. 2006 used the 10th percnetile so that's 
        the default.

    Parameters
    ----------
