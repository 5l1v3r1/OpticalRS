# Getting Started

There are two ways of using `OpticalRS`. You can use the [OpticalRS QGIS Processing Scripts](qgisprocessing.md) or you can invoke the code directly using the [Python API](pythonapi.md). Presently, the processing tools represent a small fraction of the `OpticalRS` functionality. Please see the appropriate page for more detail.
