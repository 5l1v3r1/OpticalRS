# Python API

The full functionality of `OpticalRS` can be accessed though the Python programming language.

## API Documentation

Most of (I'm working on filling in the blanks) the `OpticalRS` code has docstrings that describe the functionality. My attempts at using sphinx to generate documentation from those docstrings have failed so far. For now, please just look directly at the docstrings in the [code repository](https://github.com/jkibele/OpticalRS). If you're interested in seeing better documentation, please contact me and let me know.

## Examples

I'm working on some IPython notebooks that demonstrate the use of the API. They can be found [here](https://github.com/jkibele/OpticalRS/tree/feature/mkdocs/docs/notebooks) for now and eventually [here](https://github.com/jkibele/OpticalRS/docs/notebooks).
